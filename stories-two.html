		<p>The place is located on a high mountain slope at Shrine Hills, Matina, Davao City. The land on which Jack's Ridge now stand once formed part of the headquarter of the retreating Japanese forces towards the end of the World War II. Jack's Ridge was built to offer a completely new experience to dinners, and its not over yet, more development are under way to make it the premier dining resort in Davao City. </p>

		<p>In my life, I’ve always been fascinated with sunsets. I may baffle other people’s minds and make them think what’s wrong with me but it is something that I look forward to see – something that gives me hope. Most of the people think that sunsets symbolize end. Melancholia. Singularity. It is indeed – because know that the day is almost ending and you have to say goodbye to those people whom you seldom see, the great day is over and tomorrow is another day to get over with. But for me, whenever the sun sets, it is just the start of my day. Why do I say so? Whenever I am having a bad day, I always wish that the day would be over so I can start anew. I could wake up to another morning and be able to somehow, make up for whatever I missed the other day. This is how sunsets give me a little more push whenever I’m at my peak. It feels like it’s telling me to try a little more because tomorrow is almost there so that I could try again.
