				    	<h3>PATAG</h3>
				        <p>A place for someone who loves adventures, trekking of steep mountains to reach a cascade of water fall, dipping to its cold water, and mostly, to be with nature</p>

		<p>The area is located in Silay City. Tourist from all sorts of area wouldn't go there in particular because of not knowing the area but now due to social media post and more tourist spots created in the area in order for nature lovers to be free and away form the city life. The small town now thrives from local tourists from the city and other areas from the country.</p>

				    	<h3>MOUNTAIN VIEW</h3>
				    </div>
			</div>

		<p>Even though there are a lot of new places opened, there is still a go to place in Patag and it is the Tinagong dagat. A beautiful field on top of a mountain and it is surrounded with a mountain. Capturing a scenic view and feel of a hidden sea (sea of mountains and trees). But before that there is always a jump point or a starting point to prepare for the climb. The place that I am talking about is the hospital. Well, not necessarily a hospital but back then during the time when we were under the Japanese control it was a hospital. A mini ward for people who would get hurt during the war. To fully intensify your experience in the place, screeching doors, footsteps and all shorts of things you hear in ghost stories comes through. Well, only the things that you can imagine. Certain paranormal things might happen or it may not it just depends on you if you believe it. Try to experience it first hand if there are really ghost in the area</p>

				    	<h3>LODGE</h3>
				    </div>
			</div>

		<p>The lodge (hospital) may look creepy but inside you'll have the experience of a dorm type room. And there is still a relic infront of the hospital to remind us that this area has gone through the war that us Filipino fought through.</p>

				    	<h3>RELIC</h3>
				    </div>
			</div>

		<p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to hike to Tinagong Dagat because our trip only focused on going to the hospital and get away from the busy city life just for a moment. But the experience that we had was fun. As you can see, many building are rising from cities to another so seeing and being here feels like there are still places for you to escape away the stressful life that a city can give you. So if you want to experience nature, I suggest you go for the full experience. Hike until you get to the top. Don't let the distance affect you. Because in the end it is worth it. The destination is only an extra gift but the true adventure is your journey going to the destination.</p>
